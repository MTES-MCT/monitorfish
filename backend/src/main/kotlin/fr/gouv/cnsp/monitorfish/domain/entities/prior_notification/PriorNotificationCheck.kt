     * # Example
     *
     * - `isInVerificationScope == true && isVerified == false` => The prior notification must be manually verified.
     * - `isInVerificationScope == true && isVerified == true` => The prior notification had to be manually verified, and it was.
     * - `isInVerificationScope == false && isVerified == true` => The prior notification did not have to be manually verified, but it was.
     * - `isInVerificationScope == true && isVerified == false` => /!\ SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN.
