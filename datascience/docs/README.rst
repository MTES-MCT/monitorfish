Welcome to the documentation of the **`datascience`** part of Monitorfish. 

Data ingestion and processing in Monitorfish is performed by a dockerized python service which 
is separated from the back and front ends of the application. **This documentation describes the data 
ingestion and processing python service of Monitorfish.**

The documentation of the back end and front end resides ``<here>`` (coming soon).
