Welcome to the documentation of the `datascience` part of Monitorfish. 

Data ingestion and processing in Monitorfish is performed by a dockerized python service which is separated from the 
Kotlin Springboot backend of the application. This documentation describes the data ingestion and processing python service. 
The documentation of the backend resides `here` (coming soon!).
