Containerization
================

For each `release <https://github.com/MTES-MCT/monitorfish/releases>`__, docker images for the Kotlin Springboot backend and 
the python data processing services are pushed to the `Github package regitry <https://github.com/orgs/MTES-MCT/packages?repo_name=monitorfish>`__. 

To choose which version to pull from this registry when deploying, set the right :ref:`environment_variables`.
