"Reaching the :ref:`control objectives <risk-assessment>` defined at the "
"national level is one of the missions of the FMC. In order to reach these "
"objectives, the FMC needs a way to **target certain fleet segments** and to "
"**dynamically adapt control priorities** depending on the level of "
"achievement of the control objectives of each segment."

"In addition to the control objectives, the **seasonality of the activity** "
"on the various segments is another factor that makes it necessary for the "
"FMC to be able to adapt its control priorities dynamically. Indeed, certain "
"fleet segments are of particular interest at known periods in the year."

"The control priority level is then included  in the computation of the "
":ref:`detectability score <detectability-score>` component of the risk "
"factor. By assigning a higher control priority level to a certain fleet "
"segment, the risk factor of all vessels belonging to this fleet segment in "
"real time will be increased, and Monitorfish will automatically recommend "
"control targets that correspond to this fleet segment, thus helping the FMC "
"to reach its objectives."
