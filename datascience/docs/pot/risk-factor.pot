msgid "In addition, in order to reflect the objective of FMCs to efficiently distribute control efforts across all segments and vessels in order to miminize the possibility of violations to go undetected, a third component of *detectability* is added, which measures how well distributed accross fleet segments and accross fishing vessels of each fleet segment."
