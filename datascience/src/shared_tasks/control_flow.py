    Filters invalid results from an input mapped results list.

    Warning: It is mandatory to use `skip_on_upstream_skip = False`, otherwise the whole
    task is skipped if any of the results of the upstream mapped task raises a SKIP
    signal, which defeats the purpose of this task which is to discard the invalid
    results produced by the upstream tasks and keep the valid ones and pass them on
    downstream.

    As a consequence,

        !!!! THIS TASK WILL RUN EVEN IF THE UPSTREAM TASKS ARE SKIPPED !!!!

    This can have weird consequences, as the task can run successfully, and pass on
    successful results to downstream tasks which were also supposed to be skipped.

    This happens including in a `case` branch of a flow that should be skipped.

    In order to try to circumvent this issue, we raise a `SKIP` signal if the input is
    `None`, which is what happens if the input is provided by an upsteam task that is
    itself skipped. This does not cover all cases at all, in particular, in situations
    where tasks may be skipped (in case branch mostly) make sure not to use this task
    with input data coming from upstream tasks that may not be skipped.

    Args:
        task_results: List of (mapped) task results.
