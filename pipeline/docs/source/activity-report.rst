Activity Report
===============

The activity report (Act-Rep) export is a CSV file sent to the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) to report controls within Joint Deployment Plans (JDPs).

The JDPs are :

* **Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean** (DECISION EFCA 2018/030)
* **North Sea** (DECISION EFCA 2018/032)
* **Western Waters** (DECISION EFCA 2018/033)

A control must be reported in an Act-Rep if :

* The control is done at **Sea** within a JDP mission
* The control is done at **Air** within a JDP mission
* The control is done at **Land**, and :

  * A **species** from the controls is specified in the JDP and the **FAO zone** of the trip is specified in the JDP, or
  * A **species** from the controls is under EU Quotas (R(CE) 1224/2009 â€“ Article 14 & 15) when the vessel is a **third country** vessel (i.e GB)


Special case
------------

Note that we must double count inspections for controls in PEL13 segments in which BFT are observed. Given that they should be part also of the WW JDP (particularly considering there is a dedicated Specific Action to this Fleet Segment and the ALB fishery) :

*  All events linked to PEL13 (OTM/PTM targeting ALB and fishing/landing in Atlantic areas/ports) should be reported to the WW JDP (although they might also be reported to the MED JDP)
*  All events linked to PEL13 (OTM/PTM targeting ALB and fishing/landing in Atlantic areas/ports) in which BFT are observed should be reported to the WW JDP and to the WW MED as well
