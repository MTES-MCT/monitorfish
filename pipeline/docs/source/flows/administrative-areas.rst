Administrative areas
====================

The ``Administrative areas`` flow extracts administrative areas (FAO areas, exclusive economic areas...) from 
the CROSSA database and inserts the data into the various tables of the Monitorfish database.

It is run manually when necessary, in order to sync the Monitorfish database with the CROSSA database after an update.
