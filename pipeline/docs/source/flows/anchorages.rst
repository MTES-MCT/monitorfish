Anchorages
==========

The ``Anchorages`` flow extracts anchorage data from the open dataset on
`data.gouv.fr <https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/traces-geometriques-des-ports-du-systeme-ers/>`__, 
which is managed by the development team, and loads it to the ``anchorages`` table of the Monitorfish database.

It is run manually when needed in order to sync the Monitorfish database with the open dataset.
