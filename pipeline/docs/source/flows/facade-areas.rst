Facade areas
============

The ``Facade areas`` flow extracts facade areas (NAMO, MEMN...) from the CROSSA database and loads it to the 
``facade_areas_subdivided`` table of the Monitorfish database.

It is run manually when necessary, in order to sync the Monitorfish database with the CROSSA database after an update.
