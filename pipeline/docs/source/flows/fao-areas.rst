FAO areas
=========

The ``FAO areas`` flow extracts FAO areas from the `FAO website <http://www.fao.org/fishery/static/ASFIS>`__ and loads it to the 
``fao_areas`` table of the Monitorfish database.

It is run manually when necessary, in order to sync the Monitorfish database with the FAO website after an update.
