Recompute controls segments
===========================

The ``Recompute controls segments`` flow recomputes the segments (initially allocated by the backend when filling the inspection report form) for
the selected year and control types.

This is mostly useful when segment definitions change during the year and the segments of all controls since January 1st need
to be recomputed according to the updated definitions.
