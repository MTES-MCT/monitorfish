    Returns a list of `Period` of duration `period_duration` covering the time range

    If `overlap` is specified, the `Period` returned will overlap by the amount

    `start_datetime_utc` and ending on `end_datetime_utc`.

    series data that would take up too much memory to handle in one piece.
