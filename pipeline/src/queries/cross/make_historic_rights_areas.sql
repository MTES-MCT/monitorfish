/*
This query was used on the CROSS database to create the areas that are needed to
raise fishing alerts in the french 12 mile coastal area by non-french vessels. It
is not meant to be used by the data pipeline - only the resulting areas are needed.

It computes 3 areas on which to raise fishing alerts, depending on the flag
state of the vessel:
- one area for german vessels
- one for belgian and dutch vessels
- one for spanish vessels

The computed areas are inserted into to the n_miles_to_shore_areas table.
